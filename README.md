[SUMMER 2014] BlueChat
======================

Bluetooth instant messaging app for Android

How it works:
  - To send messages and images, we transmit them in formatted byte arrays in the following format:
      <blockquote>
      [ Message Type, Sender Name Length, ...Body Length**..., Sender ID, Sender Name, Body ]
      </blockquote>
      
    ** The Body Length is separated into tens digits (from least to most significant digit) just in case the body length exceeds the size of a byte.

Notes:
  - If having connection problems, make sure the host creates a room before a client tries to join
  
Current Bugs:
  - Sometimes quitting and rejoining a chatroom is a bit buggy
